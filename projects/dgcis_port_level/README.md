dgcis_port_level
==============================

This project focuses on collecting and processing import-export data at the port level from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) website. The data is retrieved through a web scraping process using the provided source URL, and then it undergoes a processing phase to make it suitable for further analysis.
